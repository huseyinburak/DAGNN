# DAGNN
Node Classification with Deep Adaptive Graph Neural Network 

This code allows direct execution
Make sure that all relevant modules are installed, if current versions are not used, they should be updated.

CORA Dataset can be obtained and read externally as a ".tar" file, but it is taken from the Planetoid module so that it is not necessary to define the file path while running the code.

The number of hidden layers in NN and the number of nodes in each layer can be determined dynamically.

Hyperparameters can be changed for optimization.

The output after each NN is visualized with t-SNE.

Layer number versus accuracy value is plotted.
